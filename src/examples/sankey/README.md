#  Sankey


![](sankey.png)

This diagram creates a [sankey diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram) to display sequences of transitions.S ankey diagrams are a specific type of flow diagram, in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity. Sankey diagrams are often used in fields of science, especially physics. They are used to represent energy inputs, useful output, and wasted output. Sankeys can also be used to understand how users arrive at and navigate through an application or website. 

Good use cases include: 
- Event Analytics
- Energy Flows
- Order Stages

**How it works**

Create a look with any number of dimensions and one measure.

For example, in the sankey diagram above, you can see event transition counts between the various sequences of states.
